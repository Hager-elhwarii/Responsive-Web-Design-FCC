- In this course, you'll build a set of colored markers. You'll learn different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other.
  
### ðŸ”… Primary colors: ( red, green, blue)

- primary colors are colors that, when combined, create pure white. (255,255,255) => white.

### ðŸ”… Secondary colors:
- secondary colors are the colors you get when you combine primary colors.

 (255,255,0)  => yellow.
 
 (0,255,255) => cyan.
 
 (255,0,255) =>  magenta.
 

### ðŸ”… Tertiary colors:

- tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.

(255,127,0)  => orange.

(0,255,127) => spring green.

(127,0,255) =>  violet.


### ðŸ”… There are three more tertiary colors: chartreuse 

- green => (green + yellow).

- azure  => (blue + cyan).
  
 - rose =>  (red + magenta).

### ðŸ”… Complementary colors:

- two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors.

### ðŸ”… Hexadecimal or hex values:
- Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F.

- The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue.   For example =>  #4B5320.

### ðŸ”… The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: 

- a number from 0 to 360 for hue,
  
- a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation,

-  a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

### ðŸ”… Gradient:
