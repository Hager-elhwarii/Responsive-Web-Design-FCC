## 🌸 About this Repo

- I created this repository as a resource to help you better understand Html and CSS, and was organized in a way I thought made the most sense, when i was learning it, with a number of **20  Project.**
   
- In this `Responsive Web Design Certification`, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: `HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)` for content, and `CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)` for design.
  
- First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like `CSS variables` by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

- Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with `Flexbox`, and a magazine article layout with `CSS Grid`.
